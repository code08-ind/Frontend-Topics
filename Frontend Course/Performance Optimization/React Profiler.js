// React Profiler

// The React Profiler is a built-in tool that helps developers measure the performance of their React applications. It provides insights into how components are rendering, how long they take to render, and what might be causing performance bottlenecks.

// It is installed from the React Dev Tools extension available for browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

// To use the React Profiler, follow these steps:
// 1. Install the React Dev Tools extension in your browser.
// 2. Open your React application in the browser.

// While presenting in the Interview, we can show them the React Dev Tools extension and then show them the Profiler tab.
// 3. Navigate to the "Profiler" tab in the React Dev Tools.
// 4. Click the "Start Profiling" button to begin recording performance data.
// 5. Interact with your application to capture performance data during various user interactions.
// 6. Click the "Stop Profiling" button to stop recording. 

// By using React Dev Tools, we can use it in the runtime itself and can see the performance of the application in real-time. 

// There are various different functions available in the React Dev Tools. 

// In React Profiler, we have various components and icons:

// 1. Rank Chart: This chart shows the components that took the most time to render. It helps identify which components are the most expensive in terms of rendering time.
// 2. Flamegraph: The flamegraph provides a visual representation of the component that got rendered or not.

// We also can have time line of re-rendering of the components. 

// Start From 12:00 Mins.
